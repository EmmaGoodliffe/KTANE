# KTANE

Raspberry Pi project based on the game *["Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"](keeptalkinggame.com)*

The original game describes the basic premise as:

> You’re alone in a room with a bomb. Your friends, the “Experts”, have the manual needed to defuse it. But there’s a catch: the Experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out – fast!

In this version of the game, however, the bomb is **hardware**. (It doesn't really explode though).

The code is in Python 3 and is run on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B v2.
